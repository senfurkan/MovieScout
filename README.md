In this project, I developed a single-page application using TMDB's free APIs. The application displays trending movies, series, and actors on a daily and weekly basis, organized in tabs for easy navigation. I utilized Vue 3 and TypeScript for a robust and modular structure, and designed a user-friendly interface with Vuetify 3.
